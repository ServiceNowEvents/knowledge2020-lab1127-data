These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"86826bf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5d79","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"About Windows Vista","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"2","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1977-12-31 04:52:04","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010325","sys_id":"03204d6cd7e30200b96d45a3ce610379","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1977-12-31 04:51:19","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"> About Windows Vista<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Note: If you are migrating from an older operating system, UITS strongly recommends installing Windows 7 rather than Vista.

No code in PeopleSoft has actually fired yet. The Subscription contract still needs to be created and executed by the application. Once the subscription contract executes, you should see an email in the in-box. Generally, this happens almost in real time but any number of factors could impact the code from not firing right away. T<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;\">The PeopleSoft integration broker is a \u201Cfunny bird\u201D. It will return <span class=\"caps\">HTTP<\/span> status 200 (OK) for all sorts of successes and errors. You actually have to parse the response message <span class=\"caps\">XML<\/span> to determine the actual error messages. In the python script I have given, if the response header <code style=\"color: #c7254e; font-size: 12.6000003814697px;\">TransactionID<\/code> contains a value then we assume that the integration broker accepted the <span class=\"caps\">XML<\/span> and it will be processed whenever. If that header is not present then we assume an error occurred and just dump out the <span class=\"caps\">XML<\/span>. I will leave it as an exercise for the reader to fill in more detailed error handling and response parsing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;\">We will also note that the example python script just submits an <span class=\"caps\">XML<\/span> document that looks like this:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"color: #333333; font-size: 13px; margin: 0px 0px 10px; border: 1px solid #cccccc;\">&lt;?xml version&#61;&#34;1.0&#34; ?&gt;<br \/>\n&lt;test&gt;Testing the HTTPListeningConnector.&lt;\/test&gt;<\/pre>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;\"> <\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;\">The <span class=\"caps\">XML<\/span> structure submitted really does not matter as long as the handler PeopleCode knows how to decipher it. The PeopleCode handler could parse the <span class=\"caps\">XML<\/span> and extract data and do any sort of processing like update data via <span class=\"caps\">SQL<\/span> or Component Interface, Schedule a process, or choose to ignore the data all together. Since this is an asynchronous service operation there is no way for the handler code to pass information back to the python script. For that we would have to invoke a synchronous operation which we documented in the <a style=\"color: #337ab7;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cedarhillsgroup.com\/knowledge-base\/kbarticles\/synchronous-python-post-to-integration-broker-script\" rel=\"nofollow\">Synchronous <span class=\"caps\">HTTP<\/span> Post to PeopleSoft Integration Broker using Python<\/a> article.<\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"86826bf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5d79","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"3","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":""},{"short_description":"Enable\/Disable Wireless Laptop Connections\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"3","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1979-11-15 16:41:43","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010013","sys_id":"07083ce8d7e30200b96d45a3ce6103e2","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1979-11-15 16:41:43","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"published","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Enable\/Disable Wireless Laptop Connections<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Dell Quickset Utility<\/strong><\/span><br \/>On a Dell laptop running the latest versions of Quickset and the Intel drivers (downloadable from support.dell.com), perform the following steps:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Launch the Quickset utility by double-clicking the Quickset icon in the system tray.<\/li><li>Click on <strong>Location Profiler <\/strong>in the upper left.<\/li><li>Click <strong>Modify Settings <\/strong>on the left side in the Quickset Location Profiler window<\/li><li>Select the box <strong>Disable Wi-Fi until the Wired connection is terminated<\/strong><\/li><li>Click <strong>Save<\/strong> at the bottom of the window.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>This can be very useful to those who plug into an Ethernet port so they don&#39;t have to manually disable wireless.

In fact, you may have inadvertently provided your email address (e.g., if you didn&#39;t check a box marked Don&#39;t send me product updates). In these cases, it is usually safe to reply and ask to be removed from the mailing list. <\/li><li>If it is not a company you recognize, use your judgment. To be safe, copy and paste the link to the company&#39;s site into the browser rather than clicking it in the email message. <\/li><li>If the spam is clearly from a disreputable source, never respond. Do not follow the (probably bogus) unsubscribe directions. In most cases, if you never reply, the network of spammers will eventually decide your email address is a dud, and will stop using it as often.<br \/><br \/><\/li><\/ul>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Be careful releasing your email address, and know how it will be used<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Every time you communicate on the Internet or browse a web site, there are opportunities for spammers to intercept your communications to obtain your email address and other personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise reputable companies may sell or exchange your email address with other companies, and this information may eventually find its way to a spammer. At worst, spammers will use automated programs to bombard these lists of email addresses with spam. Consider the following guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Subscribe only to essential discussion lists, and ensure that they are moderated. <\/li><li>Think twice before offering your email address to a web site. You may wish to check the site&#39;s privacy policy first to be sure it uses secure technology, and that the company does not share your email address with others. <\/li><li>If you need to list email addresses on your web site, present the addresses in a way that makes them less vulnerable to collection and abuse by spammers.<\/li><li>Every time you are asked for your email address verbally or on paper, think carefully about whether or not you want to receive any information from that company or organization. It is usually best to decline to provide your email address. <\/li><li>Whenever possible, advocate that organizations you are involved in or do business with default to the opt-in model. This requires you to specifically request to be added to their email lists, rather than the opt-out model, where they add you to email lists automatically, and then give you the option of asking to be removed. <br \/><br \/><\/li><\/ul>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Be proactive<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Adjusting the security settings in your web browser is a good preventive measure. For a higher level of security, have your browser disallow:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Accepting cookies<\/li><li>Listing your name and other personal information in your browser profile<\/li><li>Filling in form fields for you<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>This will help reduce the amount of personal information transmitted to sites at the expense of full functionality, since many legitimate web sites require you to accept cookies.<\/p>\n<p>Do not contribute to the spam problem by producing any of it yourself! In particular, learn about chain mail and do not forward chain mail to others. Also, if you receive an email message that appears to warn of some horrible thing happening (a virus that reportedly deletes all your files, for example) or is a touching sob story (about helping to save a poor sick girl or boy, for example), be suspicious.<\/p>\n<p>Nearly every instance of chain mail is a hoax. The message may even come from someone you know and respect who is simply not aware that it&#39;s a hoax. Learn about hoaxes and the sites available to verify hoaxes, and do not forward them to others. <br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Questions regarding X-rated spam (unsolicited mass e-mail)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p> Some members of the Company have at times expressed concern to IT regarding their own accountability for unsolicited e-mail of a sexual nature sent to their Company e-mail address. In some cases, an employee worries that a supervisor or co-worker might think the employee solicited the mail. In other cases, the person fears that an IT employee asked to assist with the computer might think the person had solicited the sexually-oriented mail.<\/p>\n<p>Most people who either have experienced spam or have read about spam understand that spammers do not wait to be asked; they are in the business of aggressive marketing. Many spammers are deceitful, trying to fool people into opening their unwanted e-mail by pretending to be someone else or using a subject line which fools the recipient into opening the mail. Sometimes they claim falsely that the person is receiving the e-mail because the person asked for it, or expressed interest in material of a similar nature. The truth is that few people welcome spam and even fewer ask for it.<\/p>\n<p>If a supervisor or co-worker thinks otherwise, IT can reassure them. Certainly, IT technicians and consultants understand that spam is a plague and not something invited by the recipient. As extra protection, depending upon how you receive your e-mail on campus, there are ways to quarantine spam and\/or filter your incoming e-mail.  It is advisable to immediately delete any such emails you receive.<\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"62d78687c0a8010e00b3d84178adc913","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"4","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5681bf8bff0221009b20ffffffffff95"},{"short_description":"About Windows Vista","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"3","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1979-09-24 12:55:26","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010340","sys_id":"0b608d6cd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103aa","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1979-09-24 12:55:26","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"> About Windows Vista<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Note: If you are migrating from an older operating system, UITS strongly recommends installing Windows 7 rather than Vista.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"46d14f04a9fe19810142e40c6b071512","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"Dealing with Spyware and Viruses\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"3","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1979-09-25 01:36:35","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010113","sys_id":"0b99742cd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103eb","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1979-09-25 01:36:35","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Dealing with Spyware\/Adware<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Spyware is the generic term for computer software that gathers information about you and your Internet surfing habits for marketing purposes; Adware refers to programs which gather information about you for marketing purposes in order to target your computer with advertisements (often in the form of pop-up windows.) These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use.

Equinix provides us physically secure space, highly redundant power and cooling. We get our internet connectivity from separate service providers. We own, maintain and operate the servers and the network equipment and the software. The problem was not just that the power failure happened, the problem was that it happened <em style=\"border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">abruptly<\/em>, with no warning whatsoever, and all our equipment went down all at once. Data centers, certainly this one, have triple, and even quadruple, redundancy in their power systems just to prevent such an abrupt power outage. The intent is that any power failure would have sufficient warning so that equipment, databases most importantly, can be shut down gracefully. In fact, the main function such data centers perform is to provide extreme redundancy in power systems, provide cooling for the equipment and provide physical security. Absolutely no warning happened prior to this incident, which is what we have asked our vendor to explain, and we hope they would be transparent with us. I do want to say that Equinix has served us well, they are a leader in this field, we have never suffered an abrupt power outage like this in 5&#43; years. But they do owe us and other customers in that data center an explanation for what happened on Friday.

By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"46d14f04a9fe19810142e40c6b071512","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"Dealing with Spyware and Viruses\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"2","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1979-10-01 14:17:43","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010092","sys_id":"1359342cd7e30200b96d45a3ce61033b","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1979-10-01 14:17:43","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Dealing with Spyware\/Adware<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Spyware is the generic term for computer software that gathers information about you and your Internet surfing habits for marketing purposes; Adware refers to programs which gather information about you for marketing purposes in order to target your computer with advertisements (often in the form of pop-up windows.)

Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"46d14f04a9fe19810142e40c6b071512","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"About Windows Vista","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"2","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1978-05-04 12:13:30","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010319","sys_id":"13ef3c6cd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103e2","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-04-24 12:13:30","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"> About Windows Vista<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Note: If you are migrating from an older operating system, UITS strongly recommends installing Windows 7 rather than Vista.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"46d14f04a9fe19810142e40c6b071512","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"0","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"Dealing with Spyware and Viruses\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1978-11-01 15:24:41","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010112","sys_id":"1699b42cd7e30200b96d45a3ce610314","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-04-26 12:15:41","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"draft","text":"<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Dealing with Spyware\/Adware<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Spyware is the generic term for computer software that gathers information about you and your Internet surfing habits for marketing purposes; Adware refers to programs which gather information about you for marketing purposes in order to target your computer with advertisements (often in the form of pop-up windows.)

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"a8f98bb0eb32010045e1a5115206fe3a","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"0","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"Dealing with Spyware and Viruses\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"2","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1978-05-06 12:16:13","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010058","sys_id":"18b8302cd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103c9","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"true","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-04-26 12:16:13","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Dealing with Spyware\/Adware<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Spyware is the generic term for computer software that gathers information about you and your Internet surfing habits for marketing purposes; Adware refers to programs which gather information about you for marketing purposes in order to target your computer with advertisements (often in the form of pop-up windows.)

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"0a826bf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5d7a","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"4","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"About Windows Vista","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"1","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1978-05-09 13:00:51","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010279","sys_id":"1b6f786cd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103c8","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-04-29 13:00:51","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"> About Windows Vista<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Note: If you are migrating from an older operating system, UITS strongly recommends installing Windows 7 rather than Vista.

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"6816f79cc0a8016401c5a33be04be441","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"About Windows 7","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"1","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1978-05-12 13:16:11","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010070","sys_id":"1bd8702cd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103e3","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"true","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-05-02 13:16:11","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">About Windows 7<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Windows 7 is not an upgrade to Windows Vista, but an entirely different operating system.

Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"a348378fc3701200a125dbfd81d3aeff","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"How to configure VPN for Apple Devices\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"3","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1978-05-13 13:16:12","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010148","sys_id":"1dec7c2cd7e30200b96d45a3ce610397","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-05-03 13:16:12","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>How to configure VPN for Apple Devices<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>For an iPhone or iPad running iOS?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol><li><em>Select <\/em><strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; VPN<\/strong>.&#61;<\/li><li><em>Click <\/em><strong>Add VPN Configuration<\/strong> and <em>enter <\/em>the<strong> following information<\/strong>:<\/li><li>\n<ol><li>Select <strong>L2TP<\/strong>.<\/li><li>Enter <strong>Servicenow VPN<\/strong> in the <strong>Description <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Enter <strong>vpn-nu.vpn.servicenow.edu<\/strong> in the <strong>Server <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Enter your <strong>NetID <\/strong>in the <strong>Account <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Enter your <strong>NetID password<\/strong> in the <strong>Password <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Enter <strong>servicenow<\/strong> (case sensitive) in the <strong>Secret <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Select <strong>Save<\/strong>.  <\/li><\/ol>\n<\/li><li>To connect to Servicenow VPN, <strong>VPN <\/strong>should be <em>turned <\/em><strong>On<\/strong>.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees.

While every Internet user receives some spam, email addresses posted to web sites or in newsgroups and chat rooms attract the most spam.&#39;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Definitions<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The term &#34;spam&#34; is Internet slang that refers to unsolicited commercial email (UCE) or unsolicited bulk email (UBE). Some people refer to this kind of communication as junk email to equate it with the paper junk mail that comes through the US Mail. Unsolicited email most often contains advertisements for services or products, but very few reputable marketers use UCE to advertise. The most commonly seen spam includes the following:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Phishing scams, a very popular and dangerous form of email fraud<\/li><li>Foreign bank scams or advance fee fraud schemes<\/li><li>Pyramid schemes, including multilevel marketing (MLM)<\/li><li>Other &#34;Get Rich Quick&#34; or &#34;Make Money Fast&#34; (MMF) schemes<\/li><li>Quack health products and remedies<\/li><li>Ads for pornographic web sites<\/li><li>Offers of software for collecting email addresses and sending UCE<\/li><li>Offers of bulk emailing services for sending UCE<\/li><li>Chain letters (see About chain mail)<\/li><li>Illegally pirated software (&#34;Warez&#34;)<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">To reduce the amount of spam you receive:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul><li>Don&#39;t reply to spam<\/li><li>Be careful releasing your email address, and know how it will be used<\/li><li>Be proactive  <\/li><\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Don&#39;t reply to spam<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you reply to spam, the spammer or the automated program on the other end will then know that your address is connected to a live person, and the spammer will then bombard you with even more spam, and circulate your address to other spammers. It is critical that you pause and think before replying to any spam. Consider the following guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Setting up your email account to generate automatic responses while you are away can have the unfortunate side-effect of verifying your email address to every spammer that sends you spam. <\/li><li>If the message appears to come from a legitimate company, the company may have obtained your email address from some transaction between you and the company. In fact, you may have inadvertently provided your email address (e.g., if you didn&#39;t check a box marked <span class=\"menuitem\">Don&#39;t send me product updates<\/span>). In these cases, it is usually safe to reply and ask to be removed from the mailing list. <\/li><li>If it is not a company you recognize, use your judgment. To be safe, copy and paste the link to the company&#39;s site into the browser rather than clicking it in the email message. <\/li><li>If the spam is clearly from a disreputable source, never respond. Do not follow the (probably bogus) unsubscribe directions. In most cases, if you never reply, the network of spammers will eventually decide your email address is a dud, and will stop using it as often.<\/li><\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Be careful releasing your email address, and know how it will be used<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Every time you communicate on the Internet or browse a web site, there are opportunities for spammers to intercept your communications to obtain your email address and other personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise reputable companies may sell or exchange your email address with other companies, and this information may eventually find its way to a spammer. At worst, spammers will use automated programs to bombard these lists of email addresses with spam. Consider the following guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Subscribe only to essential discussion lists, and ensure that they are moderated. <\/li><li>Think twice before offering your email address to a web site. You may wish to check the site&#39;s privacy policy first to be sure it uses secure technology, and that the company does not share your email address with others. <\/li><li>If you need to list email addresses on your web site, present the addresses in a way that makes them less vulnerable to collection and abuse by spammers.<\/li><li>Every time you are asked for your email address verbally or on paper, think carefully about whether or not you want to receive any information from that company or organization. It is usually best to decline to provide your email address. <\/li><li>Whenever possible, advocate that organizations you are involved in or do business with default to the opt-in model. This requires you to specifically request to be added to their email lists, rather than the opt-out model, where they add you to email lists automatically, and then give you the option of asking to be removed. <\/li><\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Be proactive<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Adjusting the security settings in your web browser is a good preventive measure. For a higher level of security, have your browser disallow:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Accepting cookies<\/li><li>Listing your name and other personal information in your browser profile<\/li><li>Filling in form fields for you<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>This will help reduce the amount of personal information transmitted to sites at the expense of full functionality, since many legitimate web sites require you to accept cookies.<\/p>\n<p>Do not contribute to the spam problem by producing any of it yourself! In particular, learn about chain mail and do not forward chain mail to others. Also, if you receive an email message that appears to warn of some horrible thing happening (a virus that reportedly deletes all your files, for example) or is a touching sob story (about helping to save a poor sick girl or boy, for example), be suspicious.<\/p>\n<p>Nearly every instance of chain mail is a hoax. The message may even come from someone you know and respect who is simply not aware that it&#39;s a hoax. Learn about hoaxes and the sites available to verify hoaxes, and do not forward them to others. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Questions regarding X-rated spam (unsolicited mass e-mail)<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>Some members of the Company have at times expressed concern to IT regarding their own accountability for unsolicited e-mail of a sexual nature sent to their Company e-mail address. In some cases, an employee worries that a supervisor or co-worker might think the employee solicited the mail. In other cases, the person fears that an IT employee asked to assist with the computer might think the person had solicited the sexually-oriented mail.<\/p>\n<p>Most people who either have experienced spam or have read about spam understand that spammers do not wait to be asked; they are in the business of aggressive marketing. Many spammers are deceitful, trying to fool people into opening their unwanted e-mail by pretending to be someone else or using a subject line which fools the recipient into opening the mail. Sometimes they claim falsely that the person is receiving the e-mail because the person asked for it, or expressed interest in material of a similar nature.

In previous versions of Outlook, this was known as a distribution list.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"doc-body\">\n<p>A contact group (formerly known as a distribution list) is a grouping of email addresses collected under one name. A message sent to a Contact Group goes to all recipients listed in the group. You can include Contact Groups in messages, task requests, meeting requests, and in other Contact Groups. There is no maximum number of names you can include in a Contact Group.<\/p>\n<h3>Create a Contact Group with New Names or Names in the Address Book<\/h3>\n<ol><li>In Contacts, on the <strong>Home <\/strong>tab, in the <strong>New <\/strong>group, click <strong>New Contact Group<\/strong>.<\/li><li><\/li><li>In the <strong>Name <\/strong>box, type a name for the Contact Group.<\/li><li>On the <strong>Contact Group<\/strong> tab, in the <strong>Members <\/strong>group, click <strong>Add Members<\/strong>, and then click <strong>From Outlook Contacts<\/strong>, <strong>From Address Book<\/strong> or <strong>New E-mail Contact<\/strong>.<\/li><li>If you are adding a new email contact, enter the information for the person in the <strong>Add New Member<\/strong>dialog box.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"6816f79cc0a8016401c5a33be04be441","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"About Windows Vista","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"3","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1978-05-19 07:10:22","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010321","sys_id":"28ff7c6cd7e30200b96d45a3ce610316","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-05-09 07:10:22","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"> About Windows Vista<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Note: If you are migrating from an older operating system, UITS strongly recommends installing Windows 7 rather than Vista.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"46d44a23a9fe19810012d100cca80666","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"About Windows 7","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"4","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1978-11-01 15:24:40","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010069","sys_id":"2ed8702cd7e30200b96d45a3ce610337","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-05-15 07:26:59","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">About Windows 7<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Windows 7 is not an upgrade to Windows Vista, but an entirely different operating system.

These messages usually direct you to a spoofed web site or otherwise get you to divulge private information (e.g., passphrase, credit card, or other account updates). The perpetrators then use this private information to commit identity theft.<\/p>\n<p>One type of phishing attempt is an email message stating that you are receiving it due to fraudulent activity on your account, and asking you to &#34;click here&#34; to verify your information.<\/p>\n<p>Phishing scams are crude social engineering tools designed to induce panic in the reader. These scams attempt to trick recipients into responding or clicking immediately, by claiming they will lose something (e.g., email, bank account). Such a claim is always indicative of a phishing scam, as responsible companies and organizations will never take these types of actions via email.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Specific types of phishing<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Phishing scams vary widely in terms of their complexity, the quality of the forgery, and the attacker&#39;s objective. Several distinct types of phishing have emerged.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Spear phishing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Phishing attacks directed at specific individuals, roles, or organizations are referred to as &#34;spear phishing&#34;. Since these attacks are so pointed, attackers may go to great lengths to gather specific personal or institutional information in the hope of making the attack more believable and increasing the likelihood of its success.<\/p>\n<p>The best defense against spear phishing is to carefully, securely discard information (i.e., using a cross-cut shredder) that could be used in such an attack. Further, be aware of data that may be relatively easily obtainable (e.g., your title at work, your favorite places, or where you bank), and think before acting on seemingly random requests via email or phone.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Whaling<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The term &#34;whaling&#34; is used to describe phishing attacks (usually spear phishing) directed specifically at executive officers or other high-profile targets within a business, government, or other organization.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Avoiding phishing scams<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The Company and other reputable organizations will never use email to request that you reply with your passphrase, Social Security number, or confidential personal information. Be suspicious of any email message that asks you to enter or verify personal information, through a web site or by replying to the message itself. Never reply to or click the links in a message. If you think the message may be legitimate, go directly to the company&#39;s web site (i.e., type the real URL into your browser) or contact the company to see if you really do need to take the action described in the email message.<\/p>\n<p>When you recognize a phishing message, delete the email message from your Inbox, and then empty it from the deleted items folder to avoid accidentally accessing the web sites it points to.<\/p>\n<p>Always read your email as plain text.<\/p>\n<p>Phishing messages often contain clickable images that look legitimate; by reading messages in plain text, you can see the URLs that any images point to. Additionally, when you allow your mail client to read HTML or other non-text-only formatting, attackers can take advantage of your mail client&#39;s ability to execute code, which leaves your computer vulnerable to viruses, worms, and Trojans.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Warnings<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Reading email as plain text is a general best practice that, while avoiding some phishing attempts, won&#39;t avoid them all. Some legitimate sites use redirect scripts that don&#39;t check the redirects. Consequently, phishing perpetrators can use these scripts to redirect from legitimate sites to their fake sites.<\/p>\n<p>Another tactic is to use a homograph attack, which, due to International Domain Name (IDN) support in modern browsers, allows attackers to use different languagecharacter sets to produce URLs that look remarkably like the authentic ones.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Reporting phishing attempts<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul><li>If the phishing attempt targets the Company in any way (e.g., asks for the Company&#39;s Webmail users to &#34;verify their accounts&#34;, includes a malicious PDF directed to human resources, or impersonates the Company), forward it with full headers to the Company Information Security Office. <\/li><li>You can report a phishing scam attempt to the company that is being spoofed. <\/li><li>You can also send reports to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). <\/li><li>Depending on where you live, some local authorities also accept phishing scam reports. <\/li><li>Finally, you can send details to the Anti-Phishing Working Group, which is building a database of common scams to which people can refer.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Example of a phishing scam<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The following phishing scam was targeted at Servicenow users:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"example\">-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom: &#34;SERVICENOW.ORG SUPPORT TEAM&#34; &lt;supportteam01&#64;indiana.edu&gt;\nReply-To: &#34;SERVICENOW.ORG SUPPORT TEAM&#34; &lt;spupportteam&#64;info.lt&gt;\nDate: Sat, 12 Jul 2008 17:42:05 -0400\nTo: &lt;&#34;Undisclosed-Recipient:;&#34;&#64;iocaine.uits.indiana.edu&gt;\nSubject: CONFIRM YOUR ACCOUNT\n\nDear SERVICENOW.ORG Webmail Subscriber\n\nThis mail is to inform all our {SERVICENOW.ORG} webmail users that we\nwill be maintaining and upgrading our website in a couple of days from\nnow.As a Subscriber you are required to send us your Email account\ndetails to enable us know if you are still making use of your\nmailbox.

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"6816f79cc0a8016401c5a33be04be441","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"2","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"About Windows Vista","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"2","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1978-05-27 07:28:14","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010351","sys_id":"3280cd6cd7e30200b96d45a3ce610365","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-05-17 07:28:14","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"> About Windows Vista<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Note: If you are migrating from an older operating system, UITS strongly recommends installing Windows 7 rather than Vista.

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"6816f79cc0a8016401c5a33be04be441","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"How to configure VPN for Apple Devices\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1978-06-02 07:39:09","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010141","sys_id":"34dc3c2cd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103d9","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-05-23 07:39:09","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"review","text":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>How to configure VPN for Apple Devices<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>For an iPhone or iPad running iOS?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol><li><em>Select <\/em><strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; VPN<\/strong>.&#61;<\/li><li><em>Click <\/em><strong>Add VPN Configuration<\/strong> and <em>enter <\/em>the<strong> following information<\/strong>:<\/li><li>\n<ol><li>Select <strong>L2TP<\/strong>.<\/li><li>Enter <strong>Servicenow VPN<\/strong> in the <strong>Description <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Enter <strong>vpn-nu.vpn.servicenow.edu<\/strong> in the <strong>Server <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Enter your <strong>NetID <\/strong>in the <strong>Account <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Enter your <strong>NetID password<\/strong> in the <strong>Password <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Enter <strong>servicenow<\/strong> (case sensitive) in the <strong>Secret <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Select <strong>Save<\/strong>.  <\/li><\/ol>\n<\/li><li>To connect to Servicenow VPN, <strong>VPN <\/strong>should be <em>turned <\/em><strong>On<\/strong>.

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"46d44a23a9fe19810012d100cca80666","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"0","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"How to configure VPN for Apple Devices\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1978-06-03 07:39:39","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010144","sys_id":"36dc3c2cd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103da","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-05-24 07:39:39","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"review","text":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>How to configure VPN for Apple Devices<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>For an iPhone or iPad running iOS?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol><li><em>Select <\/em><strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; VPN<\/strong>.&#61;<\/li><li><em>Click <\/em><strong>Add VPN Configuration<\/strong> and <em>enter <\/em>the<strong> following information<\/strong>:<\/li><li>\n<ol><li>Select <strong>L2TP<\/strong>.<\/li><li>Enter <strong>Servicenow VPN<\/strong> in the <strong>Description <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Enter <strong>vpn-nu.vpn.servicenow.edu<\/strong> in the <strong>Server <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Enter your <strong>NetID <\/strong>in the <strong>Account <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Enter your <strong>NetID password<\/strong> in the <strong>Password <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Enter <strong>servicenow<\/strong> (case sensitive) in the <strong>Secret <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Select <strong>Save<\/strong>.  <\/li><\/ol>\n<\/li><li>To connect to Servicenow VPN, <strong>VPN <\/strong>should be <em>turned <\/em><strong>On<\/strong>.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"f298d2d2c611227b0106c6be7f154bc8","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"How do I quit an application that isn't responding?\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"3","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1978-06-06 07:41:10","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010419","sys_id":"392385acd7e30200b96d45a3ce610369","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-05-27 07:41:10","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>How do I quit an application that isn&#39;t responding in Mac OS X?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>In Mac OS X, you may occasionally find that applications lock up and do not respond to any commands, including Quit.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"5137153cc611227c000bbd1bd8cd2005","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"0","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"Create And Edit A Contact Group\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"3","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1978-06-10 08:43:10","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010263","sys_id":"3aeef46cd7e30200b96d45a3ce610394","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-05-31 07:43:10","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Outlook 2010 - Create And Edit A Contact Group (Formerly Distribution Lists)<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<div id=\"doc-summary\">\n<p>This article explains how to create and edit a contact group in Outlook 2010.

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"6816f79cc0a8016401c5a33be04be441","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"About Windows Vista","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"3","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1978-06-13 08:51:57","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010354","sys_id":"3c90cd6cd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103af","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-06-03 07:51:57","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"> About Windows Vista<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Note: If you are migrating from an older operating system, UITS strongly recommends installing Windows 7 rather than Vista.

Equinix provides us physically secure space, highly redundant power and cooling. We get our internet connectivity from separate service providers. We own, maintain and operate the servers and the network equipment and the software. The problem was not just that the power failure happened, the problem was that it happened <em style=\"border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">abruptly<\/em>, with no warning whatsoever, and all our equipment went down all at once. Data centers, certainly this one, have triple, and even quadruple, redundancy in their power systems just to prevent such an abrupt power outage. The intent is that any power failure would have sufficient warning so that equipment, databases most importantly, can be shut down gracefully. In fact, the main function such data centers perform is to provide extreme redundancy in power systems, provide cooling for the equipment and provide physical security. Absolutely no warning happened prior to this incident, which is what we have asked our vendor to explain, and we hope they would be transparent with us. I do want to say that Equinix has served us well, they are a leader in this field, we have never suffered an abrupt power outage like this in 5&#43; years. But they do owe us and other customers in that data center an explanation for what happened on Friday.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization.

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"0a826bf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5d7a","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"0","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"Dealing with Spyware and Viruses\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"2","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1978-06-26 10:48:57","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010090","sys_id":"4a59342cd7e30200b96d45a3ce610336","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-06-16 09:48:57","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Dealing with Spyware\/Adware<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Spyware is the generic term for computer software that gathers information about you and your Internet surfing habits for marketing purposes; Adware refers to programs which gather information about you for marketing purposes in order to target your computer with advertisements (often in the form of pop-up windows.)

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully.

Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options.

However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so.

Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement.

We own, maintain and operate the servers and the network equipment and the software.

Data centers, certainly this one, have triple, and even quadruple, redundancy in their power systems just to prevent such an abrupt power outage. The intent is that any power failure would have sufficient warning so that equipment, databases most importantly, can be shut down gracefully. In fact, the main function such data centers perform is to provide extreme redundancy in power systems, provide cooling for the equipment and provide physical security. Absolutely no warning happened prior to this incident, which is what we have asked our vendor to explain, and we hope they would be transparent with us. I do want to say that Equinix has served us well, they are a leader in this field, we have never suffered an abrupt power outage like this in 5&#43; years. But they do owe us and other customers in that data center an explanation for what happened on Friday.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"6816f79cc0a8016401c5a33be04be441","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"0","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"About Windows Vista","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"3","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1978-07-14 11:11:27","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010330","sys_id":"5a304d6cd7e30200b96d45a3ce61037b","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-07-04 11:11:27","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"> About Windows Vista<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Note: If you are migrating from an older operating system, UITS strongly recommends installing Windows 7 rather than Vista.

Equinix provides us physically secure space, highly redundant power and cooling. We get our internet connectivity from separate service providers. We own, maintain and operate the servers and the network equipment and the software. The problem was not just that the power failure happened, the problem was that it happened <em style=\"border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">abruptly<\/em>, with no warning whatsoever, and all our equipment went down all at once. Data centers, certainly this one, have triple, and even quadruple, redundancy in their power systems just to prevent such an abrupt power outage. The intent is that any power failure would have sufficient warning so that equipment, databases most importantly, can be shut down gracefully. In fact, the main function such data centers perform is to provide extreme redundancy in power systems, provide cooling for the equipment and provide physical security. Absolutely no warning happened prior to this incident, which is what we have asked our vendor to explain, and we hope they would be transparent with us. I do want to say that Equinix has served us well, they are a leader in this field, we have never suffered an abrupt power outage like this in 5&#43; years. But they do owe us and other customers in that data center an explanation for what happened on Friday. They restored power quickly, but the damage was done because of the abruptness of the outage.<\/span><\/div>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"a9c0c8d2c6112276018f7705562f9cb0","author":"a348378fc3701200a125dbfd81d3aeff","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"News","category":"","kb_category":"b85c6552ff0131009b20ffffffffffd4"},{"short_description":"About Windows Vista","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"4","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1978-07-18 11:47:47","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010362","sys_id":"5aa001acd7e30200b96d45a3ce610378","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-07-05 11:11:59","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"> About Windows Vista<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Note: If you are migrating from an older operating system, UITS strongly recommends installing Windows 7 rather than Vista.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"6816f79cc0a8016401c5a33be04be441","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"About Windows Vista","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"1","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1978-07-17 10:12:50","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010378","sys_id":"5cd041acd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103a7","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-07-07 11:12:50","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"> About Windows Vista<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Note: If you are migrating from an older operating system, UITS strongly recommends installing Windows 7 rather than Vista.

Equinix provides us physically secure space, highly redundant power and cooling. We get our internet connectivity from separate service providers. We own, maintain and operate the servers and the network equipment and the software. The problem was not just that the power failure happened, the problem was that it happened <em style=\"border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">abruptly<\/em>, with no warning whatsoever, and all our equipment went down all at once. Data centers, certainly this one, have triple, and even quadruple, redundancy in their power systems just to prevent such an abrupt power outage. The intent is that any power failure would have sufficient warning so that equipment, databases most importantly, can be shut down gracefully. In fact, the main function such data centers perform is to provide extreme redundancy in power systems, provide cooling for the equipment and provide physical security. Absolutely no warning happened prior to this incident, which is what we have asked our vendor to explain, and we hope they would be transparent with us. I do want to say that Equinix has served us well, they are a leader in this field, we have never suffered an abrupt power outage like this in 5&#43; years. But they do owe us and other customers in that data center an explanation for what happened on Friday.

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"46d14f04a9fe19810142e40c6b071512","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"Enable\/Disable Wireless Laptop Connections\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1978-07-18 11:25:57","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010012","sys_id":"62083ce8d7e30200b96d45a3ce6103e0","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-07-11 11:15:13","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"draft","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Enable\/Disable Wireless Laptop Connections<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Dell Quickset Utility<\/strong><\/span><br \/>On a Dell laptop running the latest versions of Quickset and the Intel drivers (downloadable from support.dell.com), perform the following steps:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Launch the Quickset utility by double-clicking the Quickset icon in the system tray.<\/li><li>Click on <strong>Location Profiler <\/strong>in the upper left.<\/li><li>Click <strong>Modify Settings <\/strong>on the left side in the Quickset Location Profiler window<\/li><li>Select the box <strong>Disable Wi-Fi until the Wired connection is terminated<\/strong><\/li><li>Click <strong>Save<\/strong> at the bottom of the window.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>This can be very useful to those who plug into an Ethernet port so they don&#39;t have to manually disable wireless.

We own, maintain and operate the servers and the network equipment and the software.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"7682abf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5d1c","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"0","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"About Windows Vista","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"2","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"2020-03-02 08:12:18","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010355","sys_id":"6990cd6cd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103d7","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"2020-03-02 06:23:24","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"> About Windows Vista<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Note: If you are migrating from an older operating system, UITS strongly recommends installing Windows 7 rather than Vista.

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"be82abf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5d1c","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"Are Copyrighted Files Illegal to Have On My\t\t\tComputer?\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"2020-02-27 08:38:24","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010246","sys_id":"6d9eb46cd7e30200b96d45a3ce61032b","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"2020-02-27 06:25:24","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"review","text":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Are Copyrighted Files Illegal to Have On My Computer?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Tools built to make use of the Internet easier have created special concerns for the holders of copyright. While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"be82abf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5d1c","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"0","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"How can I secure my Android OS device?\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"4","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"2020-02-22 09:09:30","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010176","sys_id":"6e3dfc2cd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103b5","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"2020-02-22 06:24:27","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">How can I secure my Android OS device?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To secure the data on your mobile device, you should always use a pattern, PIN, passcode, or password to lock your device.

Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"be82abf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5d1c","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"0","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"How do I quit an application that isn't responding?\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"2020-03-24 08:53:26","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010410","sys_id":"724105acd7e30200b96d45a3ce610331","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"2020-03-24 06:22:33","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"review","text":"<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>How do I quit an application that isn&#39;t responding in Mac OS X?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>In Mac OS X, you may occasionally find that applications lock up and do not respond to any commands, including Quit.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"62826bf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5df1","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"How can I secure my Android OS device?\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"4","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"2020-03-26 08:51:06","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010186","sys_id":"745d306cd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103b6","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"2020-03-26 06:21:19","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">How can I secure my Android OS device?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To secure the data on your mobile device, you should always use a pattern, PIN, passcode, or password to lock your device.

Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it.

We own, maintain and operate the servers and the network equipment and the software.

Data centers, certainly this one, have triple, and even quadruple, redundancy in their power systems just to prevent such an abrupt power outage. The intent is that any power failure would have sufficient warning so that equipment, databases most importantly, can be shut down gracefully. In fact, the main function such data centers perform is to provide extreme redundancy in power systems, provide cooling for the equipment and provide physical security. Absolutely no warning happened prior to this incident, which is what we have asked our vendor to explain, and we hope they would be transparent with us. I do want to say that Equinix has served us well, they are a leader in this field, we have never suffered an abrupt power outage like this in 5&#43; years. But they do owe us and other customers in that data center an explanation for what happened on Friday.

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below.

Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain.

And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement.

For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees.

Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement.

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"a2826bf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5ded","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"0","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"What is a cookie?\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"4","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"2020-02-06 10:37:18","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0000007","sys_id":"7c8f75b5474321009db4b5b08b9a71b5","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"2020-02-06 06:22:25","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>What is a cookie?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Cookies are messages that web servers pass to your web browser when you visit Internet sites.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users.

Equinix provides us physically secure space, highly redundant power and cooling. We get our internet connectivity from separate service providers. We own, maintain and operate the servers and the network equipment and the software.

Data centers, certainly this one, have triple, and even quadruple, redundancy in their power systems just to prevent such an abrupt power outage. The intent is that any power failure would have sufficient warning so that equipment, databases most importantly, can be shut down gracefully. In fact, the main function such data centers perform is to provide extreme redundancy in power systems, provide cooling for the equipment and provide physical security. Absolutely no warning happened prior to this incident, which is what we have asked our vendor to explain, and we hope they would be transparent with us. I do want to say that Equinix has served us well, they are a leader in this field, we have never suffered an abrupt power outage like this in 5&#43; years. But they do owe us and other customers in that data center an explanation for what happened on Friday.

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so.

Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"62826bf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5df1","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"How can I find the MAC address of my Ethernet or\t\t\twireless","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"2020-02-17 09:58:49","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010026","sys_id":"87387ce8d7e30200b96d45a3ce6103af","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"2020-02-17 06:24:46","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"draft","text":"<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>How can I find the MAC address of my Ethernet or wireless interface in Mac OS X?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>In Mac OS X, your MAC (Media Access Control) address is distinct from the IP address assigned to your Mac, and is defined by the hardware of each Ethernet orAirPort interface.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"be82abf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5d1c","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"Dealing with Spyware and Viruses\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"2020-02-01 10:37:09","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010102","sys_id":"8a79742cd7e30200b96d45a3ce610337","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"2020-02-01 06:25:07","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"draft","text":"<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Dealing with Spyware\/Adware<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Spyware is the generic term for computer software that gathers information about you and your Internet surfing habits for marketing purposes; Adware refers to programs which gather information about you for marketing purposes in order to target your computer with advertisements (often in the form of pop-up windows.) These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"4e826bf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5d57","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"0","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"About Windows Vista","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"3","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"2020-02-21 10:13:12","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0000018","sys_id":"8a9a897187032100deddb882a2e3ec24","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"2020-02-21 06:23:41","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"> About Windows Vista<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Note: If you are migrating from an older operating system, UITS strongly recommends installing Windows 7 rather than Vista.

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"a2826bf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5ded","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"0","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"Deleted Email Recovery\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"1","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"2020-03-23 09:19:05","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0000030","sys_id":"8aef1935474321009db4b5b08b9a7113","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"2020-03-23 06:21:49","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"published","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Deleted Email Recovery<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>By default, every email deleted from your OWA mailbox goes through the following process:<\/p>\n<ol><li>The email is moved to your Deleted Items folder.<\/li><li>If you purge or remove items from your Deleted Items folder they will be moved to the Dumpster where they are still recoverable.<\/li><li>The Dumpster only holds email message for 14 days once they&#39;ve been removed from Deleted Items.<\/li><\/ol>\n<p>Deleted email can be recovered from the Deleted Items folder or the Dumpster.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"a2826bf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5ded","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"How do I quit an application that isn't responding?\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"3","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"2020-02-16 08:45:29","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010429","sys_id":"8e43c5acd7e30200b96d45a3ce610333","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"true","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"2020-02-16 06:25:26","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>How do I quit an application that isn&#39;t responding in Mac OS X?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>In Mac OS X, you may occasionally find that applications lock up and do not respond to any commands, including Quit.

Equinix provides us physically secure space, highly redundant power and cooling. We get our internet connectivity from separate service providers. We own, maintain and operate the servers and the network equipment and the software. The problem was not just that the power failure happened, the problem was that it happened <em style=\"border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">abruptly<\/em>, with no warning whatsoever, and all our equipment went down all at once. Data centers, certainly this one, have triple, and even quadruple, redundancy in their power systems just to prevent such an abrupt power outage. The intent is that any power failure would have sufficient warning so that equipment, databases most importantly, can be shut down gracefully. In fact, the main function such data centers perform is to provide extreme redundancy in power systems, provide cooling for the equipment and provide physical security. Absolutely no warning happened prior to this incident, which is what we have asked our vendor to explain, and we hope they would be transparent with us. I do want to say that Equinix has served us well, they are a leader in this field, we have never suffered an abrupt power outage like this in 5&#43; years. But they do owe us and other customers in that data center an explanation for what happened on Friday. They restored power quickly, but the damage was done because of the abruptness of the outage.<\/span><\/div>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"a9c0c8d2c6112276018f7705562f9cb0","author":"7682abf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5d1c","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"News","category":"","kb_category":"b85c6552ff0131009b20ffffffffffd4"},{"short_description":"Are Copyrighted Files Illegal to Have On My\t\t\tComputer?\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"2020-03-13 10:38:07","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010210","sys_id":"90bdb06cd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103dc","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"2020-03-13 06:24:12","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"draft","text":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Are Copyrighted Files Illegal to Have On My Computer?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Tools built to make use of the Internet easier have created special concerns for the holders of copyright. While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities.

So in this example, the data in table CHG_POSITION_DATA will be read and packaged into a bunch of service operations in the integration broker depending on the size of the table and the app server configuration.

This application engine just creates the service operation \u201Coperation instances\u201D. The operations then have to publish and get subscribed to. The application engine does not wait around for that or even have a \u201Cwindow\u201D into that integration broker activity. <strong>Therefore, the application will run to \u201Csuccess\u201D and you cannot trust the data is actually published until you verify that is published in the integration broker and the subscription contracts in the subscription side completed.<\/strong> If you are not familiar with these steps you should read our <a style=\"color: #337ab7;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cedarhillsgroup.com\/knowledge-base\/kbarticles\/high-level-overview-of-integration-broker-publishing-steps\" rel=\"nofollow\">High Level Overview of Integration Broker Publishing Steps<\/a> kb article.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"color: #333333; font-size: 30px;\">Subscription Steps<\/h2>\n<p style=\"color: #333333; font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;\">The subscription side as very similar setup in regards to the publishing service operation.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"71826bf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5d3b","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"About Windows Vista","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"4","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"2020-03-26 10:08:49","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010336","sys_id":"94608d6cd7e30200b96d45a3ce61036d","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"2020-03-26 06:22:20","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"> About Windows Vista<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Note: If you are migrating from an older operating system, UITS strongly recommends installing Windows 7 rather than Vista.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"46b87022a9fe198101a78787e40d7547","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"About Windows Vista","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"2","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"2020-03-05 08:07:31","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010293","sys_id":"989fb86cd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103a9","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"2020-03-05 06:22:24","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"> About Windows Vista<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Note: If you are migrating from an older operating system, UITS strongly recommends installing Windows 7 rather than Vista.

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use.

Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"a2826bf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5ded","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"Sales Force Automation is DOWN","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"2020-03-26 07:58:29","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010041","sys_id":"9a78bce8d7e30200b96d45a3ce6103b3","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"2020-03-26 06:15:54","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"review","text":"<p> <\/p>\n<div style=\"border: 0px; font-family: &#39;open sans&#39;; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #444444; font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: 0.4000000059604645px; line-height: 27px; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;\"><span style=\"border: 0px; font-family: Verdana, arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">On Friday, January 20th, we experienced a widespread outage that affected all Zoho services. The outage started around 8:13 am Pacific Time. Zoho services started coming back online for customer use at 3:49 pm, and all services were fully restored at 6:22 pm PST. We absolutely realize how important our services are for businesses and users who rely on us; we let you down on Friday.

Equinix provides us physically secure space, highly redundant power and cooling. We get our internet connectivity from separate service providers. We own, maintain and operate the servers and the network equipment and the software. The problem was not just that the power failure happened, the problem was that it happened <em style=\"border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">abruptly<\/em>, with no warning whatsoever, and all our equipment went down all at once. Data centers, certainly this one, have triple, and even quadruple, redundancy in their power systems just to prevent such an abrupt power outage. The intent is that any power failure would have sufficient warning so that equipment, databases most importantly, can be shut down gracefully. In fact, the main function such data centers perform is to provide extreme redundancy in power systems, provide cooling for the equipment and provide physical security. Absolutely no warning happened prior to this incident, which is what we have asked our vendor to explain, and we hope they would be transparent with us. I do want to say that Equinix has served us well, they are a leader in this field, we have never suffered an abrupt power outage like this in 5&#43; years. But they do owe us and other customers in that data center an explanation for what happened on Friday. They restored power quickly, but the damage was done because of the abruptness of the outage.<\/span><\/div>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"a9c0c8d2c6112276018f7705562f9cb0","author":"a2826bf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5ded","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"0","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"News","category":"","kb_category":"b85c6552ff0131009b20ffffffffffd4"},{"short_description":"How to configure VPN for Apple Devices\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"3","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"2020-03-17 08:10:10","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010132","sys_id":"9bbcf82cd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103af","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"2020-03-17 06:21:28","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>How to configure VPN for Apple Devices<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>For an iPhone or iPad running iOS?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol><li><em>Select <\/em><strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; VPN<\/strong>.&#61;<\/li><li><em>Click <\/em><strong>Add VPN Configuration<\/strong> and <em>enter <\/em>the<strong> following information<\/strong>:<\/li><li>\n<ol><li>Select <strong>L2TP<\/strong>.<\/li><li>Enter <strong>Servicenow VPN<\/strong> in the <strong>Description <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Enter <strong>vpn-nu.vpn.servicenow.edu<\/strong> in the <strong>Server <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Enter your <strong>NetID <\/strong>in the <strong>Account <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Enter your <strong>NetID password<\/strong> in the <strong>Password <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Enter <strong>servicenow<\/strong> (case sensitive) in the <strong>Secret <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Select <strong>Save<\/strong>.  <\/li><\/ol>\n<\/li><li>To connect to Servicenow VPN, <strong>VPN <\/strong>should be <em>turned <\/em><strong>On<\/strong>.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"71826bf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5d3b","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"Create And Edit A Contact Group\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"4","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"2020-03-20 08:41:48","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010268","sys_id":"9ffe386cd7e30200b96d45a3ce61034f","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"true","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"2020-03-20 06:22:29","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Outlook 2010 - Create And Edit A Contact Group (Formerly Distribution Lists)<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<div id=\"doc-summary\">\n<p>This article explains how to create and edit a contact group in Outlook 2010.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"62826bf03710200044e0bfc8bcbe5df1","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"About Windows Vista","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"2","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"2020-03-10 08:10:53","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010352","sys_id":"ab80cd6cd7e30200b96d45a3ce610365","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"2020-03-10 06:25:37","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"> About Windows Vista<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Note: If you are migrating from an older operating system, UITS strongly recommends installing Windows 7 rather than Vista.

Vista Capable minimum hardware requirements are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul><li>A modern processor (at least 800 MHz)<\/li><li>512 MB of system memory<\/li><li>A graphics processor that is DirectX 9 capable<\/li><li>20 GB of hard drive capacity with 15 GB free space<\/li><li>CD-ROM drive<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Vista Premium Ready computers can take full advantage of the features available in Vista, including the Windows Aero advanced graphical interface. Microsoft lists the minimum hardware requirements for Vista Premium as follows:<\/p>\n<ul><li>1 GHz 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor <br \/>UITS recommends: A dual-core (Core 2) processor <\/li><li>1 GB of system memory <br \/>UITS recommends: 2 GB system memory <\/li><li>A graphics processor that is DirectX 9 capable with Hardware Pixel Shader v2.0 and WDDM Driver support <\/li><li>128 MB of graphics memory <br \/>UITS recommends: 256 MB graphics memory; non-integrated video card <\/li><li>40 GB of hard drive capacity with 15 GB free space <br \/>UITS recommends: 80-100 GB capacity <\/li><li>DVD-ROM drive <\/li><li>Audio output capability <\/li><li>Internet access capability<\/li><\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Vista versions<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you&#39;re upgrading from Vista Home Premium, you need to upgrade to Vista Ultimate (notVista Business) if you want to keep Windows Media Center.

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"46d14f04a9fe19810142e40c6b071512","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"0","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"Are Copyrighted Files Illegal to Have On My\t\t\tComputer?\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"2","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1979-03-02 18:53:56","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010209","sys_id":"b3adb06cd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103d9","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-01-27 01:00:00","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Are Copyrighted Files Illegal to Have On My Computer?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Tools built to make use of the Internet easier have created special concerns for the holders of copyright. While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization.

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"46d14f04a9fe19810142e40c6b071512","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"0","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"Create And Edit A Contact Group\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"2","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1979-03-02 18:55:57","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010257","sys_id":"b4def46cd7e30200b96d45a3ce610344","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-01-27 01:00:00","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Outlook 2010 - Create And Edit A Contact Group (Formerly Distribution Lists)<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<div id=\"doc-summary\">\n<p>This article explains how to create and edit a contact group in Outlook 2010.

Data centers, certainly this one, have triple, and even quadruple, redundancy in their power systems just to prevent such an abrupt power outage. The intent is that any power failure would have sufficient warning so that equipment, databases most importantly, can be shut down gracefully. In fact, the main function such data centers perform is to provide extreme redundancy in power systems, provide cooling for the equipment and provide physical security. Absolutely no warning happened prior to this incident, which is what we have asked our vendor to explain, and we hope they would be transparent with us.

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"46d14f04a9fe19810142e40c6b071512","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"About Windows Vista","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"3","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1979-03-02 18:44:31","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010300","sys_id":"b8aff86cd7e30200b96d45a3ce61030e","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-01-27 01:00:00","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"> About Windows Vista<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Note: If you are migrating from an older operating system, UITS strongly recommends installing Windows 7 rather than Vista.

Equinix provides us physically secure space, highly redundant power and cooling. We get our internet connectivity from separate service providers. We own, maintain and operate the servers and the network equipment and the software. The problem was not just that the power failure happened, the problem was that it happened <em style=\"border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">abruptly<\/em>, with no warning whatsoever, and all our equipment went down all at once. Data centers, certainly this one, have triple, and even quadruple, redundancy in their power systems just to prevent such an abrupt power outage. The intent is that any power failure would have sufficient warning so that equipment, databases most importantly, can be shut down gracefully. In fact, the main function such data centers perform is to provide extreme redundancy in power systems, provide cooling for the equipment and provide physical security. Absolutely no warning happened prior to this incident, which is what we have asked our vendor to explain, and we hope they would be transparent with us. I do want to say that Equinix has served us well, they are a leader in this field, we have never suffered an abrupt power outage like this in 5&#43; years. But they do owe us and other customers in that data center an explanation for what happened on Friday. They restored power quickly, but the damage was done because of the abruptness of the outage.<\/span><\/div>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"a9c0c8d2c6112276018f7705562f9cb0","author":"46d14f04a9fe19810142e40c6b071512","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"News","category":"","kb_category":"b85c6552ff0131009b20ffffffffffd4"},{"short_description":"About Windows Vista","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"1","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1979-03-02 18:45:18","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010373","sys_id":"c1c041acd7e30200b96d45a3ce610364","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-01-27 01:00:00","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"> About Windows Vista<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Note: If you are migrating from an older operating system, UITS strongly recommends installing Windows 7 rather than Vista.

Computer?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Tools built to make use of the Internet easier have created special concerns for the holders of copyright. While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so.

Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"46d14f04a9fe19810142e40c6b071512","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"0","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"How can I secure my Android OS device?\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"4","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1979-03-02 18:53:11","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010174","sys_id":"d13dfc2cd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103e2","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-07-19 00:00:00","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">How can I secure my Android OS device?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To secure the data on your mobile device, you should always use a pattern, PIN, passcode, or password to lock your device.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose.

Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization.

Equinix provides us physically secure space, highly redundant power and cooling. We get our internet connectivity from separate service providers. We own, maintain and operate the servers and the network equipment and the software. The problem was not just that the power failure happened, the problem was that it happened <em style=\"border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">abruptly<\/em>, with no warning whatsoever, and all our equipment went down all at once. Data centers, certainly this one, have triple, and even quadruple, redundancy in their power systems just to prevent such an abrupt power outage. The intent is that any power failure would have sufficient warning so that equipment, databases most importantly, can be shut down gracefully. In fact, the main function such data centers perform is to provide extreme redundancy in power systems, provide cooling for the equipment and provide physical security. Absolutely no warning happened prior to this incident, which is what we have asked our vendor to explain, and we hope they would be transparent with us. I do want to say that Equinix has served us well, they are a leader in this field, we have never suffered an abrupt power outage like this in 5&#43; years. But they do owe us and other customers in that data center an explanation for what happened on Friday. They restored power quickly, but the damage was done because of the abruptness of the outage.<\/span><\/div>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"a9c0c8d2c6112276018f7705562f9cb0","author":"46d14f04a9fe19810142e40c6b071512","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"0","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"News","category":"","kb_category":"b85c6552ff0131009b20ffffffffffd4"},{"short_description":"About Windows Vista","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"2","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1979-03-02 18:45:19","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010299","sys_id":"d4aff86cd7e30200b96d45a3ce610348","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-01-27 01:00:00","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"> About Windows Vista<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Note: If you are migrating from an older operating system, UITS strongly recommends installing Windows 7 rather than Vista.

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/b><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <b>Close<\/b> or select the active window and use <b>Alt &#43; F4 <\/b>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/b><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"46d14f04a9fe19810142e40c6b071512","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"2","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"Excel Functionality","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"2","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1979-03-02 18:45:19","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010193","sys_id":"d87d706cd7e30200b96d45a3ce61037c","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-01-27 01:00:00","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Excel Functionality<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Copying formulas without changing cell locations<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<ol><li><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">When you want to know how to copy a formula and keep portions of the formula from changing relative to where they are being copied, p<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">recede each portion of the cell specifications that aren&#39;t supposed to change with $.<\/span><\/li><li><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">For example, if a formula contains the cell reference: B2, which is not supposed to change if the formula is copied to another cell, then change B2 to $B$2<\/span><\/li><li><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">If, for example, the column specification, B, can change in B2, but not the row specification, 2, then change B2 to B$2 Similarly, if the row specification, 2, can change in B2, but not the column specification, B, then change B2 to $B2<br \/><br \/><\/span><\/li><\/ol>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">How to use formula to manipulate data in Col A and put results in Col B<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<ol><li><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Type a value in box A1<\/span><\/li><li><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Click box B1<\/span><\/li><li><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Click the Summation (sigma) notation symbol in to toolbar (autosum)<\/span><\/li><li><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">In the formula box, type &#34;*1.03&#34;

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"46d14f04a9fe19810142e40c6b071512","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"How do I quit an application that isn't responding?\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"4","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1979-03-02 18:54:54","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010396","sys_id":"db0181acd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103ff","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-01-27 01:00:00","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>How do I quit an application that isn&#39;t responding in Mac OS X?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>In Mac OS X, you may occasionally find that applications lock up and do not respond to any commands, including Quit.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action.

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"46d14f04a9fe19810142e40c6b071512","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"How to configure VPN for Apple Devices\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"3","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1979-03-02 18:51:31","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010143","sys_id":"dedc7c2cd7e30200b96d45a3ce610334","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-01-28 01:00:00","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>How to configure VPN for Apple Devices<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>For an iPhone or iPad running iOS?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol><li><em>Select <\/em><strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; VPN<\/strong>.&#61;<\/li><li><em>Click <\/em><strong>Add VPN Configuration<\/strong> and <em>enter <\/em>the<strong> following information<\/strong>:<\/li><li>\n<ol><li>Select <strong>L2TP<\/strong>.<\/li><li>Enter <strong>Servicenow VPN<\/strong> in the <strong>Description <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Enter <strong>vpn-nu.vpn.servicenow.edu<\/strong> in the <strong>Server <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Enter your <strong>NetID <\/strong>in the <strong>Account <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Enter your <strong>NetID password<\/strong> in the <strong>Password <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Enter <strong>servicenow<\/strong> (case sensitive) in the <strong>Secret <\/strong>field.<\/li><li>Select <strong>Save<\/strong>.  <\/li><\/ol>\n<\/li><li>To connect to Servicenow VPN, <strong>VPN <\/strong>should be <em>turned <\/em><strong>On<\/strong>.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users.

Vista Capable computers are able to run Vista, but may have limitations in the functionality of some features. Vista Capable minimum hardware requirements are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul><li>A modern processor (at least 800 MHz)<\/li><li>512 MB of system memory<\/li><li>A graphics processor that is DirectX 9 capable<\/li><li>20 GB of hard drive capacity with 15 GB free space<\/li><li>CD-ROM drive<\/li><\/ul>\n<p>Vista Premium Ready computers can take full advantage of the features available in Vista, including the Windows Aero advanced graphical interface.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"46d14f04a9fe19810142e40c6b071512","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"Eclipse configuration for Android development\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"3","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1979-03-23 12:53:33","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0000033","sys_id":"e97ee81eff6002009b20ffffffffffe0","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1977-10-29 01:00:00","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"pending_retirement","text":"<h2>Installing the Eclipse Plugin<\/h2>\n<p>Android offers a custom plugin for the Eclipse IDE, called Android Development Tools (ADT).

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"46d14f04a9fe19810142e40c6b071512","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"About Windows Vista","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"3","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1979-03-02 18:45:19","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010323","sys_id":"ed204d6cd7e30200b96d45a3ce61031c","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"true","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-01-27 01:00:00","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"> About Windows Vista<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Note: If you are migrating from an older operating system, UITS strongly recommends installing Windows 7 rather than Vista.

Equinix provides us physically secure space, highly redundant power and cooling. We get our internet connectivity from separate service providers. We own, maintain and operate the servers and the network equipment and the software. The problem was not just that the power failure happened, the problem was that it happened <em style=\"border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">abruptly<\/em>, with no warning whatsoever, and all our equipment went down all at once. Data centers, certainly this one, have triple, and even quadruple, redundancy in their power systems just to prevent such an abrupt power outage. The intent is that any power failure would have sufficient warning so that equipment, databases most importantly, can be shut down gracefully. In fact, the main function such data centers perform is to provide extreme redundancy in power systems, provide cooling for the equipment and provide physical security. Absolutely no warning happened prior to this incident, which is what we have asked our vendor to explain, and we hope they would be transparent with us. I do want to say that Equinix has served us well, they are a leader in this field, we have never suffered an abrupt power outage like this in 5&#43; years. But they do owe us and other customers in that data center an explanation for what happened on Friday. They restored power quickly, but the damage was done because of the abruptness of the outage.<\/span><\/div>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"a9c0c8d2c6112276018f7705562f9cb0","author":"46d14f04a9fe19810142e40c6b071512","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"0","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"News","category":"","kb_category":"b85c6552ff0131009b20ffffffffffd4"},{"short_description":"Dealing with Spyware and Viruses\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1979-03-22 09:37:00","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010101","sys_id":"ed79742cd7e30200b96d45a3ce61031a","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1979-03-22 09:37:00","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"draft","text":"<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Dealing with Spyware\/Adware<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Spyware is the generic term for computer software that gathers information about you and your Internet surfing habits for marketing purposes; Adware refers to programs which gather information about you for marketing purposes in order to target your computer with advertisements (often in the form of pop-up windows.) These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"46d14f04a9fe19810142e40c6b071512","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"0","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"About Windows 7","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"2","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1979-03-02 18:44:31","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010085","sys_id":"ee09f02cd7e30200b96d45a3ce610312","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1978-01-27 01:00:00","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"retired","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">About Windows 7<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Windows 7 is not an upgrade to Windows Vista, but an entirely different operating system.

Equinix provides us physically secure space, highly redundant power and cooling. We get our internet connectivity from separate service providers. We own, maintain and operate the servers and the network equipment and the software. The problem was not just that the power failure happened, the problem was that it happened <em style=\"border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">abruptly<\/em>, with no warning whatsoever, and all our equipment went down all at once. Data centers, certainly this one, have triple, and even quadruple, redundancy in their power systems just to prevent such an abrupt power outage. The intent is that any power failure would have sufficient warning so that equipment, databases most importantly, can be shut down gracefully. In fact, the main function such data centers perform is to provide extreme redundancy in power systems, provide cooling for the equipment and provide physical security. Absolutely no warning happened prior to this incident, which is what we have asked our vendor to explain, and we hope they would be transparent with us. I do want to say that Equinix has served us well, they are a leader in this field, we have never suffered an abrupt power outage like this in 5&#43; years. But they do owe us and other customers in that data center an explanation for what happened on Friday.

Equinix provides us physically secure space, highly redundant power and cooling. We get our internet connectivity from separate service providers. We own, maintain and operate the servers and the network equipment and the software. The problem was not just that the power failure happened, the problem was that it happened <em style=\"border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">abruptly<\/em>, with no warning whatsoever, and all our equipment went down all at once. Data centers, certainly this one, have triple, and even quadruple, redundancy in their power systems just to prevent such an abrupt power outage. The intent is that any power failure would have sufficient warning so that equipment, databases most importantly, can be shut down gracefully. In fact, the main function such data centers perform is to provide extreme redundancy in power systems, provide cooling for the equipment and provide physical security. Absolutely no warning happened prior to this incident, which is what we have asked our vendor to explain, and we hope they would be transparent with us.

These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer&#39;s software and\/or networking protocol.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Webster&#39;s <em>Collegiate Dictionary<\/em>, a computer virus is &#34;a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)&#34;. Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.\n<p>Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.<\/p>\n<\/li><li>Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. <br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term &#34;Trojan&#34; to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.<\/li><\/ul>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware\/Adware from your computer:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Preventing Spyware \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Choose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware\/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware\/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and &#34;Read Me&#34; files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa&#39;s latest version cannot be installed without Spyware\/Adware.<\/p>\n<p>Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware\/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose <strong>Close<\/strong> or select the active window and use <strong>Alt &#43; F4 <\/strong>on your keyboard.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Removing SpyWare \/ Adware<\/strong><\/span><br \/>Many Spyware\/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft&#39;s AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See &#34;Obtaining Technical Assistance&#34; below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"46d14f04a9fe19810142e40c6b071512","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"1","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"General","category":"","kb_category":"6bfb6552ff0131009b20ffffffffff66"},{"short_description":"How do I quit an application that isn't responding?\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1979-03-22 10:19:42","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010426","sys_id":"f63385acd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103ae","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1979-03-22 10:19:42","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"review","text":"<p> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>How do I quit an application that isn&#39;t responding in Mac OS X?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>In Mac OS X, you may occasionally find that applications lock up and do not respond to any commands, including Quit.

While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.<\/p>\n<p>But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the &#34;fair use&#34; exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the &#34;fair use&#34; criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>But what if I own legal copies of the material?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called &#34;private&#34; sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What is legal to download?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How will the rights-holder know?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and\/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.<\/p>\n<p>The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What happens if I get caught?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#34;statutory&#34; damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For &#34;willful&#34; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney&#39;s fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.<\/p>\n<p>Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.<\/p>\n<p>Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.<\/p>\n<p>Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>","sys_created_by":"pa.demo","display_attachments":"false","__status":"success","image":"","sys_view_count":"0","article_type":"text","cmdb_ci":"","author":"46d14f04a9fe19810142e40c6b071512","can_read_user_criteria":"","sys_mod_count":"0","active":"true","cannot_read_user_criteria":"","published":"","sys_domain_path":"\/","sys_tags":"","meta_description":"","kb_knowledge_base":"a7e8a78bff0221009b20ffffffffff17","meta":"","topic":"Policies","category":"","kb_category":"5a7b2552ff0131009b20ffffffffffb1"},{"short_description":"How can I secure my Android OS device?\t\t","roles":"","wiki":null,"direct":"false","rating":"","description":"","source":"","sys_updated_on":"1979-03-22 09:52:48","disable_suggesting":"false","sys_class_name":"kb_knowledge","number":"KB0010160","sys_id":"f81dbc2cd7e30200b96d45a3ce6103a8","use_count":"0","sys_updated_by":"pa.demo","flagged":"false","disable_commenting":"false","sys_created_on":"1979-03-22 09:52:48","sys_domain":"global","valid_to":"2100-01-01","retired":"","workflow_state":"draft","text":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">How can I secure my Android OS device?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To secure the data on your mobile device, you should always use a pattern, PIN, passcode, or password to lock your device.
